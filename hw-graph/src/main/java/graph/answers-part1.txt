## CSE 331 hw-graph Part 1 Questions

## Part 1

Briefly explain why you included the operations you did and why you feel they are a sufficient
interface to a graph. If your design includes multiple classes or interfaces, explain why you
included each one; if not, explain whether you considered additional classes and why you decided
not to include them.

For the Edge class, I added the constructor that takes in a label, incoming and outgoing node. This is so that an
Edge can only exist with at least two other nodes. The incoming and outgoing node can be the same node however, so that
the edge directs back to itself. I also added getLabel and editLabel so the Edge's label can be retrieved and also
changed to a new label just in case the user wishes to do so.

For the Node class, I added a single constructor that simply takes in a String label to label the node being created.
I also added a listChildren method that can be used to get a list of children this node may have. The node class also
allows getting and editing the label.

The node and the edge class go hand and hand and that was my intention. They relate to eachother in the sense that
you can't have an edge unless it is directly related to atleast one edge.

The Graph class ties both the Nodes and Edges in together. It will use a list of nodes to print out all nodes in the
graph and it makes use of edges to perhaps iterate through the nodes using the direction of the edges.

What was your testing strategy for this assignment? How do your script tests and JUnit tests
differ from each other (if they do), and why?

JUnit tests go more in depth into each individual method in each of the classes while my script tests are a more broad
and more base case test. They incorporate the basic things that need to be able to be done with each of the classes.
