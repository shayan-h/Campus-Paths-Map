# Tests if a graph can be created and if nodes can be added and if children can be listed

# Create a graph
created graph graph1

# Add a pair of nodes
added node n1 to graph1
added node n2 to graph1

# Add an edge
added edge e1 from n1 to n2 in graph1

# Print the nodes in the graph and the outgoing edges from n1
graph1 contains: n1 n2

# Print the outgoing edges from n1
the children of n1 in graph1 are: n2(e1)
