# Find a path with Dijkstra's algorithm

created graph simpleGraph

added node A to simpleGraph
added node B to simpleGraph
added node C to simpleGraph
added node D to simpleGraph
added node E to simpleGraph
added node F to simpleGraph

added edge 1.000 from A to C in simpleGraph
added edge 1.000 from C to D in simpleGraph
added edge 1.000 from D to F in simpleGraph
added edge 3.000 from F to C in simpleGraph
added edge 1.000 from C to B in simpleGraph
added edge 10.000 from A to B in simpleGraph

path from A to B:
A to C with weight 1.000
C to B with weight 1.000
total cost: 2.000
