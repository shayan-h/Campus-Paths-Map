Briefly list any changes you made to your graph class during hw-marvel,
and why you made those changes.

Removed Node because it was already essentially a repetition of a string.

Changed Graph into a Hashmap of nodes as keys and a list of edges as the values because
of time complexity issues in the BFS implementation. (Basically trying to cut down as
many for loops as possible).

Added a getAllEdges method to graph to easily access all edges associated with a given
node to easily implement BFS.
